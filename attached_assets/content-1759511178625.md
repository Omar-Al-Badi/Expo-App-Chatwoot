# Popup

The popup chat displays at the bottom right of the page when the user clicks a button. For an example of what it looks like, see our [support chat](https://talkjs.com/?chat).

Users can't switch between conversations in a popup. Therefore, you may want to use both the popup and the inbox in your application: the popup right by its context, and the inbox on its own page so that users can get back to old conversations. Alternatively, you may want to use buttons to [switch between conversations](https://talkjs.com/docs/Features/Chat_UI_Modes/Switching_Between_Conversations/).

Note that only a single popup can be shown at a time.

## [Anchor](https://talkjs.com/docs/Features/Chat_UI_Modes/The_Popup_Widget/\#how-to-display-a-popup) How to display a popup

The popup chat UI is available as part of the [JavaScript SDK](https://talkjs.com/docs/Reference/JavaScript_Chat_SDK/Popup/) and as a [React](https://talkjs.com/docs/Reference/React_SDK/Components/Popup/) component. The example below shows the JS SDK, but the idea is similar for the React SDK.

The following code sets up a conversation between two sample users and then displays it in a popup with the `createPopup` method. In this example we've set `show` to `false` so that the popup doesn't appear until you click the button:

```pt-4 overflow-x-auto pb-4 block

```

You'll need to replace `<APP_ID>` with your TalkJS App ID. You can find your App ID in the **Settings** tab of the [TalkJS dashboard](https://talkjs.com/dashboard/login).

You may also want to create your own button to click on. As an example, say you have the following button:

```pt-4 overflow-x-auto pb-4 block

```

You can then add an event handler to show the popup:

```pt-4 overflow-x-auto pb-4 block

```

To make your popup persistent across page loads, change the `keepOpen` setting to `true`. See the [`createPopup` method](https://talkjs.com/docs/Reference/JavaScript_Chat_SDK/Session/#Session__createPopup) reference docs for more options.
