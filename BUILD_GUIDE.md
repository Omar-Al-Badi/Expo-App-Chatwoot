## üîß Build Profiles Explained

Your `eas.json` has 3 build profiles:

### `preview` (APK - For Testing)
```bash
eas build --platform android --profile preview
```
- Builds an **APK** file
- Can be installed directly on devices
- Perfect for testing before Play Store release
- **Use this for most testing**

### `production` (AAB - For Play Store)
```bash
eas build --platform android --profile production
```
- Builds an **AAB** (Android App Bundle)
- Required for Google Play Store
- Optimized file size
- Use when ready to publish

### `development` (Development Build)
```bash
eas build --platform android --profile development
```
- For development with custom native code
- Not needed for most Expo apps

## üéØ Important Notes

### Backend Configuration

Your app needs to connect to your backend. Make sure:

1. **Backend is running** when testing the APK
2. **Update backend URL** in the APK:
   - Edit the build command with env variable:
   ```bash
   EXPO_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=https://your-domain.com eas build --platform android --profile preview
   ```

   Or set it permanently in `eas.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "build": {
       "preview": {
         "android": {
           "buildType": "apk"
         },
         "env": {
           "EXPO_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL": "https://your-production-domain.com"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

### Free Tier Limits

- **30 builds/month** (free)
- **Low-priority queue** (may take longer during peak hours)
- **Best times to build**: Late night / weekends (faster queue)

### Troubleshooting

**Build stuck in queue?**
- Free tier uses low-priority queue
- Wait time can be 1-6+ hours during peak times
- Check status: https://status.expo.dev/

**Build failed?**
- View logs: `eas build:view [build-id]`
- Common issues:
  - Missing dependencies in package.json
  - Environment variable issues
  - Asset/image path problems

**Need to rebuild?**
```bash
# Delete old builds to save space in dashboard
eas build:delete [build-id]

# Start fresh build
eas build --platform android --profile preview --clear-cache
```
